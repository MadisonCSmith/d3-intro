// jQuery is library that simplifies client side javascript. 
// It makes a lot of tasks less verbose.
// We imported it in the HTML Headers and we can use it across different js files. 

// jQuery calls all code in $() when the page is done loading. 
$(function () {
    console.log("The page loaded with jquery :)")
})

// It is especially useful for making changes to the HTML.
// D3 mirrors a lot of this functionality and it's worth going through the basics of jquery.
